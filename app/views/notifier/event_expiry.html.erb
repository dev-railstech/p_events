Hello <%= @user.name %>,

  We just wanted to let you know that the event “<%= @event.title %>” you created through TaskFish has auto expired. We wiped , deleted, and purged all the photos ,     comments, and history of the event. Just for the records your event had <%= @event.pictures.length %> photos, <%= @event.pictures.length %> comments, and <%= @event.im_in.length %> number of people.
